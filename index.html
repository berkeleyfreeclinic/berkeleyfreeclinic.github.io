<ul>
<li>Find an EHR system that is sustainable, HIPAA-compliant and fits the unique needs of the different sections of the Berkeley Free Clinic.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="stage-1" class="anchor" href="#stage-1"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Stage 1</h3>

<ul>
<li>Gather information and explore different EHR systems.<br>
</li>
<li>Deadline 9/15/14</li>

<a name="action-1-find-out-operational-needs-of-each-section-for-an-ehr-system" class="anchor" href="#action-1-find-out-operational-needs-of-each-section-for-an-ehr-system"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Action 1: Find out operational needs of each section for an EHR system.</h5>

<p>Based on past analysis, these are some of our "wants" for an EHR system that we have identified. One thing to note is that it will be very difficult for us to find a system that fulfills all of these wants and that we need to be able to think about how we may be able to to change protocols and <strong>why</strong> our protocols are the way they are.</p>

<p><em>BFC EHR Needs</em>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Operable on small laptops or e-books from exam rooms. (Med, GMHC)</li>
<li>Print labels for specimens, requisitions and medications. (Med, GMHC)</li>
<li>Be able to store demographic information such as income, housing, student status, insurance... Must also have the capability of generating reports by year (% clients living under federal poverty level seen in 2013) (Funding)</li>
<li>Include templates that allow us to chart in ways consistent with existing protocols. (Med)</li>
<li>Convenient and intuitive. Charting must not take longer than it would to chart on paper. (Med, GMHC)</li>
</ul><p><em>BFC EHR Wants</em>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Off site record access for outreach events such as Steamworks shift (GMHC)</li>
<li>Ability to turn access to EHR off to some or all volunteers at times when clinic is not open. (GMHC)</li>
<li>Data access or input by cell phone/iPad</li>
<li>Lab integration (when Quest completes a lab, that information is uploaded to a client's chart) (Med, GMHC)</li>
<li>Patient portal for clients to access their own chart and test results.</li>
<li>Ability to print confidential morbidity reports. (GMHC, Med)</li>
</ul><p><em>To Do</em><br>
Report back by next Monday.</p>

<ul>
<li>HPS Operational Needs (Sol)</li>
<li>HepTEV Operational Needs (Joon)</li>
<li>Saturday Services Operational Needs</li>
<li>PCC Operational Needs</li>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/75456426"><em>Microsoft Access</em></a><br>
The microsoft access is the system that we currently use. Barry has figured out how to extend it's capabilities to include password protection. Click the bolded header above "Microsoft Access" to go to a video Barry developed. Password "bfc".</p>

<ul>
<li>Very customized for our needs since it is developed by us.<br>
</li>
<li>Stored on local network so it cannot be accessed outside the clinic.<br>
</li>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Stored on local network so if something happens to the clinic (flood, earthquake, etc.) our information would be lost.</li>
<li>As with any system that is "designed" for the BFC, it runs the risk of failing when if the designer leaves. Barry has indicated that he intends to stick around for a long time, however.</li>
</ul><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/76897828"><em>Open EMR</em></a>
Open EMR is a highly extendable record system that is primarily developed for clinics running in developing countries. Click the bolded header above "Open EMR" to go to another video Barry created explaining how it would work. Password same as above.</p>

<ul>
<li>Very customized for our needs since it is developed by us.<br>
</li>
<li>Stored on local network so it cannot be accessed outside the clinic with the added benefit that we can store it on an external server if we wanted to.<br>
</li>
<li>Free</li>
<li>As with any system that is "designed" for the BFC, it runs the risk of failing when if the designer leaves. Barry has indicated that he intends to stick around for a long time, however.<br>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Practice Fusion</em><br>
Practice fusion was one of the first EHR systems we explored. However, practice fusion often emphasizes it's role as an administrative software and is very adept at dealing with problems that we do not face at the BFC.</p>

<ul>
<li>Very responsive support team.</li>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Interface cluttered by options we do not necessarily need.</li>
<li>Charting is difficult for med sxn protocols.</li>
</ul><p><em>drChrono</em><br>
DrChrono is another cloud-based EHR system that differs from other systems because it's interface is focused on "tablet" charting. While we won't be using tablets, it turns out that the way they have implemented their charting system may be exactly what the med sxn needs to fit with their protocol-based medicine style. The downside is that in order for us to get the features we want, it may not be free (~30/month)</p>

<ul>
<li>Charting system fits our needs.<br>
</li>
<li>Not free.<br>
</li>
<li>Interface cluttered by options we do not necessarily need.<br>
</li>
</ul><p><em>KareoEHR</em><br>
KareoEHR is another free EHR system with a very intuitive interface and slimmed down options. However, it doesn't have the ability to store many of the demographic information we need and it doesn't look like we can work around it.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Intuitive interface</li>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Limited demographic options.</li>
<li>Charting system is limited.</li>
</ul><p><em>To Do</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Watch Barry's OpenEHR and Access videos (everyone)<br>
</li>
<li>Explore practice fusion<br>
</li>
<li>Explore drChrono (Jason M., Joon)<br>
</li>
<li>Explore KareoEHR<br>
</li>
