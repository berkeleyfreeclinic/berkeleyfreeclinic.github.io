#BFC Electronic Health Record Project

###Goals
- Find an EHR system that is sustainable, HIPAA-compliant and fits the unique needs of the different sections of the Berkeley Free Clinic.

###Stage 1
- Gather information and explore different EHR systems.  
- Deadline 9/15/14

Action 1: Find out operational needs of each section for an EHR system.  
Based on past analysis, these are some of our "wants" for an EHR system that we have identified. One thing to note is that it will be very difficult for us to find a system that fulfills all of these wants and that we need to be able to think about how we may be able to to change protocols and **why** our protocols are the way they are.

####BFC EHR Needs
- Operable on small laptops or e-books from exam rooms. (Med, GMHC)
- Print labels for specimens, requisitions and medications. (Med, GMHC)
- Be able to store demographic information such as income, housing, student status, insurance... Must also have the capability of generating reports by year (% clients living under federal poverty level seen in 2013) (Funding)
- Include templates that allow us to chart in ways consistent with existing protocols. (Med)
- Convenient and intuitive. Charting must not take longer than it would to chart on paper. (Med, GMHC)

####BFC EHR Wants
- Off site record access for outreach events such as Steamworks shift (GMHC)
- Ability to turn access to EHR off to some or all volunteers at times when clinic is not open. (GMHC)
- Data access or input by cell phone/iPad
- Lab integration (when Quest completes a lab, that information is uploaded to a client's chart) (Med, GMHC)
- Patient portal for clients to access their own chart and test results.
- Ability to print confidential morbidity reports.
